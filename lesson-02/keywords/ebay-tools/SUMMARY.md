## Evaluation

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Volume >= 500 | FAIL | Max 320, below 500 threshold |
| KD <= 40% | PASS | 24-28% for best keywords |
| Commercial Intent | PARTIAL | Mostly Informational |
| CPC > $0 | UNKNOWN | Not shown in data |
| B2B Potential | YES | eBay sellers = paying customers |

---

## Recommendation: NO-GO (Low Volume)

**Reason:** Volume below 500 threshold (max 320)

**However - Considerations:**
- eBay has 132M active users
- Sellers are paying customers (B2B)
- Few quality Chrome extensions in CWS
- Combined volume across keywords ~1K+

**Alternative Strategy:**
1. If building for eBay anyway - can capture multiple long-tail keywords
2. Position as "ebay seller tools" + "ebay listing tool" combined
3. Focus on AI-powered features for differentiation
4. Monetize through subscription (sellers have budget)

**Risk factors:**
- Small niche = limited growth
- eBay API restrictions possible
- Competition from established desktop tools

## Global Distribution

- "Where is advanced listing" = UX problem

**Opportunity:**
- Create better UX than eBay's own tools
- Focus on bulk operations
- AI-powered description generation
