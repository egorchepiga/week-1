## Evaluation

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Volume >= 500 | ❌ FAIL | Max 260, main keyword 140 |
| KD <= 40% | ✅ PASS | 19-25% for best keywords |
| Commercial Intent | ✅ PASS | Scheduler keywords are Commercial |
| CPC > $0 | ✅ PASS | $3.91 for scheduler |
| Trend | ⚠️ UNKNOWN | Emerging platform, likely growing |

---

## Recommendation: NO-GO (for now)

**Reason:** Volume too low (max 260, below 500 threshold)

**However:**
- Bluesky is emerging platform with exponential growth
- Volume likely to increase significantly in 2025
- First-mover advantage possible
- Consider as **WATCH LIST** candidate

**Alternative strategy:**
- Monitor volume monthly
- Enter when main keyword reaches 500+ volume
- Prepare MVP now, launch when market ready
