- **KD:** 25% (Easy)
- **CPC:** $3.04
- **Competitive Density:** 0.06 (Very Low)

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. Informational Intent (BLOCKER)
Users search for **"how to record"**, not **"recording tool"**.

Top questions searched:
- "how to record google meet" (2.9K)
- "how to record a google meet" (1.9K)
- "can you record a google meet" (880)

### 2. Low SERP Softness (~20%)
Top 10 results dominated by:
- Google Support documentation
- Blog articles ("How to...")
- Reddit discussions

Only 2/10 results are actual software tools.

### 3. Google's Built-in Feature
Google Meet has **native recording** for Workspace users. Extension competes with free Google feature.

### 4. Strong SaaS Competition
- **tldv.io** — Free AI meeting recorder
- **otter.ai** — AI transcription + recording
- **Riverside** — Professional recording
- **Descript** — Video editing + recording

## Monetization Concerns

### Problem 1: Free Google Feature
Google Workspace users can record natively. Extension targets users WITHOUT Workspace — typically:
- Personal Google accounts
- Small businesses without Workspace
- One-time meeting recorders

**Willingness to pay:** LOW — looking for free solution

### Problem 2: Freemium SaaS Competition
tldv.io, otter.ai offer FREE tiers with generous limits.

**Question:** Why pay for extension when free SaaS exists?

---

## Recommendations

### If Proceeding (NOT RECOMMENDED):

1. **Differentiate from SaaS:**
   - Local storage (privacy-focused)
   - No account required
   - One-time payment vs subscription

2. **Target Non-Workspace Users:**
   - Personal accounts
   - Guest participants
   - "When native recording unavailable"

3. **Alternative Keywords to Explore:**
   - "google meet screen recorder"
   - "record google meet without permission" (risky)
   - "google meet capture"

### Better Alternatives:

Consider pivoting to:
- **Zoom Recorder** (separate product)
- **Microsoft Teams Recorder**
- **Webinar Recording** tools

## Final Verdict

| Criteria | Status | Score |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Volume | PASS | 8/10 |
| KD | PASS | 8/10 |
| Softness | FAIL | 2/10 |
| Intent | FAIL | 2/10 |
| Competition | CAUTION | 4/10 |
| Monetization | FAIL | 2/10 |

**Total: 26/60 — NO-GO**

---

## Key Takeaway

> **The extension already ranks #2** but this is a **trap**.
>
> Informational intent means users want instructions, not software.
> Low softness means Google prioritizes documentation over tools.
> Free SaaS alternatives make monetization difficult.
>
> **Recommendation:** Do NOT invest further in this niche.
> Consider selling or abandoning the extension.
