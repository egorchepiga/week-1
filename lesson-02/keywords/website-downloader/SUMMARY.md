## Final Verdict

### NO-GO Reasons

| # | Reason | Severity |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | High competition (20+ extensions) | Critical |
| 2 | High average KD (50%+) | High |
| 3 | Mostly informational intent | High |
| 4 | httrack established brand | Medium |
| 5 | Video variations dominate | Medium |

### Conditional GO Scenario

Could be reconsidered IF:
- [ ] Focus exclusively on "website copier" keyword
- [ ] Build AI-powered solution (differentiation)
- [ ] Target "copy website code with ai" (1K volume)
- [ ] Avoid competing with httrack directly

### Recommendation

> **Do not pursue this niche as primary target.**
>
> The combination of high competition, high keyword difficulty, and mostly informational intent makes this niche unattractive for a new Chrome extension.
>
> **Alternative:** If interested in this space, consider the AI-powered angle targeting "copy website code with ai" (1K volume, untapped).
