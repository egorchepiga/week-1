## Analysis

### Difficulty Note
> "You will need to have 53 referring domains and optimized content to compete here."

### Observations
1. **High KD (59%)** - Difficult to rank
2. **Mostly informational intent** - Users looking for how-to, not extensions
3. **Video-focused variations** - Most popular variations are about video downloading
4. **Low competitive density (0.01)** - Not many advertisers
5. **Global demand is high** - 19.3K global vs 2.4K US

### Concerns
- Intent is "Informational" not "Commercial/Transactional"
- Most variations about video/movie downloading (different product)
- High KD makes SEO difficult
