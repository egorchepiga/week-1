## Analysis

### Difficulty Note
> "A competitive keyword to rank for. You will need well-structured and unique content."

### Observations
1. **Good volume (1,600 US)** - Better than "website downloader" variants
2. **Lower KD (47%)** - In "Possible" zone
3. **Low CPC ($0.58)** - Moderate commercial interest
4. **Informational intent** - Users looking for how-to
5. **Video/music variations dominate** - Not about website downloading

### Concerns
- Intent is purely informational
- Most variations about video/music downloading
- Not specific to website/page downloading

### Verdict
- Could be secondary keyword
- Volume is decent but variations are off-topic
