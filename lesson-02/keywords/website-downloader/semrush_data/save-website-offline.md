## Analysis

### Difficulty Note
> "A competitive keyword to rank for. You will need well-structured and unique content."

### Observations
1. **Very low volume (50)** - Not worth targeting
2. **Lower KD (45%)** - More achievable but volume too low
3. **Zero CPC** - No commercial value
4. **Mostly non-US traffic** - Only 4.3% from US

### Verdict
- Volume too low to be viable as primary keyword
- Could be used as secondary/supporting keyword
