## Analysis

### Difficulty Note
> "A competitive keyword to rank for. You will need well-structured and unique content."

### Observations
1. **Good volume (1,000 US)** - Decent traffic potential
2. **Lower KD (40%)** - In "Possible" zone
3. **Mixed intent (I + T)** - Transactional present!
4. **CPC $3.83** - Good commercial value
5. **Competitive Density 0.26** - Some advertisers interested

### Positive Signs
- Transactional intent present = buyers exist
- CPC $3.83 = advertisers value this traffic
- "clone a website with ai" - AI differentiation opportunity
- Lower KD than main "website downloader" keyword

### Concerns
- India dominates (26.4%) - not US-focused
- "super clone watch" variations (counterfeit products)
- US only 9.1% of traffic

### Verdict
- **INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE** to main keyword
- Better intent mix (transactional present)
- Higher CPC than "website downloader"
- Could be viable as primary keyword
