## Analysis

### Difficulty Note
> "A competitive keyword to rank for. You will need well-structured and unique content."

### Observations
1. **HIGHEST VOLUME (8,100 US)** - Best keyword in this research!
2. **Commercial intent** - Buyers looking for tools!
3. **KD 46%** - In "Possible" zone
4. **CPC $3.72** - Good commercial value
5. **25 Ads running** - Active advertisers = proven market
6. **Competitive Density 0.34** - Strong commercial interest

### Positive Signs
- Commercial intent = ready to buy/use
- 25 active ads = proven monetizable keyword
- "easy scraper - one-click web scraper" (2.9K) - Chrome ext already exists
- Massive global volume (172.8K)
- Lower KD than expected for such volume

### Concerns
- Different niche (scraping vs downloading)
- Python-heavy variations (developer audience)
- US only 4.7% of global traffic
- Established competitors ("easy scraper" already branded)

### Verdict
- **DIFFERENT NICHE** - Web scraping is NOT website downloading
- However, this is a MUCH BETTER opportunity if pivoting
- Commercial intent + high volume + active ads = viable market
- Consider as SEPARATE research target, not part of "website downloader"
