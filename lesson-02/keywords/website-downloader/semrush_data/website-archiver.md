## Analysis

### Difficulty Note
> "You will need to have 45 referring domains and optimized content to compete here."

### Observations
1. **Low US volume (480)** - Below minimum threshold
2. **High KD (59%)** - Difficult zone
3. **NAVIGATIONAL intent** - Users looking for archive.org!
4. **High CPC ($4.57)** - But navigational intent negates value
5. **US only 2.9%** - Very low US share

### Critical Issues
- **Navigational intent = NO-GO** - Users are searching for archive.org/wayback machine
- All variations are about Internet Archive (archive.org)
- Not searching for a tool, searching for a specific website

### Verdict
- **NO-GO** - Navigational intent is a blocker
- Cannot compete with archive.org brand searches
- Users want the specific website, not a tool
