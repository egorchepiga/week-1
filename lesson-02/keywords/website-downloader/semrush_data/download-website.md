## Analysis

### Difficulty Note
> "You will need to have 100 referring domains and optimized content to compete here."

### Observations
1. **High KD (53%)** - Difficult to rank
2. **100% Informational intent** - Users looking for how-to guides

### Concerns

- Intent is purely informational
- Video downloading dominates the variations
- Need 100 referring domains to compete
