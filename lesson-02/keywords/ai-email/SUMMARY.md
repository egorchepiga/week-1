## Recommendation: CONDITIONAL GO (High Competition)

**Reason:** Excellent volume metrics, but crowded market

**Pros:**
- Volume exceeds threshold by 40x+ (22.2K vs 500)
- US-centric market (47.1% from US)
- CPC indicates commercial value ($1.17)
- KD acceptable for "ai email generator" (36%)
- "free" variation has low KD (25%)

**Concerns:**
- Web competition is MASSIVE (ChatGPT, Gmail AI, Jasper, etc.)
- Informational intent = users want free tools
- Extension-specific keywords have NO volume (<20)
- AI email = commoditized feature, hard to differentiate
- Many established players (Grammarly, Jasper, Copy.ai)

**Strategy if proceeding:**
1. Target "ai email generator free" (3.6K, KD 25%) as primary
2. Focus on Chrome extension-specific use case
3. Differentiate with specific workflows:
   - Gmail integration
   - Cold email templates
   - Follow-up sequences
   - Tone adjustment

**Risk factors:**
- Extremely competitive space
- Users may prefer web apps (ChatGPT, Claude)
- Extension may not rank for web-focused queries
- Feature becoming commoditized (built into Gmail, Outlook)
