## Assessment

**Pros:**
- Existing extension (Table Capture) has 200K+ users
- Clear functional utility (table extraction)
- Multiple export formats (Excel, Word, CSV)

**Cons:**
- VERY LOW volume (280 total for main cluster)
- HIGH KD (46% = Difficult zone)
- Intent is NAVIGATIONAL (brand search for existing extension!)
- No easy keywords found (all 46%+ KD)
- Related "copy table" cluster also low volume (470)

**Key Insight:**
- "Navigational" intent means users are searching for the EXISTING extension
- This is a BRAND search, not a feature search
- Very hard to compete with established brand

**Verdict:** POOR opportunity. Low volume + High KD + Brand dominance = SKIP

## Comparison with Other Ideas

| Idea | Total Volume | Average KD | Best Opportunity |
|------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| YouTube Summarizer | 61,190 | 42% | KD 20-31% keywords exist |
| Web to PDF | 490 (ext) | 31% | KD 29-33% keywords |
| ChatGPT Exporter | 3,420 | 31% | KD 10-16% keywords! |
| **Table Capture** | **280** | **46%** | **None (all 46%+)** |

---

## Recommendation

**DO NOT PURSUE** this idea for SEO/ASO strategy:
- Volume too low to justify effort
- KD too high for new extension
- Market dominated by existing brand (Table Capture)

Consider only if:
- You want to compete on features, not SEO
- You have alternative traffic sources (Product Hunt, social)
