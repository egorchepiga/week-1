## Assessment

**Pros:**
- VERY LOW average KD (25%) — Best among all 6 ideas!
- Clear user need (ChatGPT lacks pin feature natively)
- Multiple "how to" and "can you" keywords = easy to rank
- Low competition (many n/a KD = very low search competition)
- Informational intent = users looking for solution
- Extension keyword exists (10 volume)

**Cons:**
- Low total volume (640)
- Niche feature (may not scale)
- ChatGPT could add native pin feature anytime
- Single platform dependency (ChatGPT)

**Key Insight:**
- Users are actively searching for a pin/organize feature that ChatGPT doesn't have
- LOW competition = easy entry point
- However, platform risk is HIGH (ChatGPT may add feature)

**Verdict:** MODERATE opportunity. LOW competition but LOW volume + platform risk.

## Target Keywords Strategy
