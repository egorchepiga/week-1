Google changed it to show the names in black, with just a colored dot to the left of the name to show the event's color. This extension changes the text color back to the event's color, and hides the dots. Events take up slightly less space without the dots.\n\nTO CLARIFY, this extension does NOT add new colors, nor does it provide a new way to choose colors. That function is already built into Google Calendar: (1) Each of your calendars has a default color; that calendar's events are shown in that color unless changed. You can change a calendar's color in the Settings. (2) When creating or editing an event, there's a dot that shows the event's color; click the dot to change the color.\n\nOpen source, hosted on GitHub.

With Auto Punctuation enabled you no longer need to say \"period\" or \"question mark\" at the end of a sentence. Just pause briefly after each sentence and the punctuation will be added automatically!\n\tSpeech Recognition Anywhere now works in Word Online with a few bugs: It first tries to type the speech in \"Tell me what you want to do\" box and you have to click in the word processor box again. \"New Line\" and \"New Paragraph\" commands do not seem to work.\n\tBug Fix for TinyMCE: Now it capitalizes the first letter of a sentence if it follows punctuation.\n\tBug Fix for CKEditor: After saying \"new line\" now the first letter of a sentence is capitalized.\n\n2/1/2018 - Version 0.99.9 - All commands have been translated to work in Spanish!"

This works for even the most complex formulas: from SUM, COUNTIF, AVERAGE, to VLOOKUP, QUERY, REGEX, and more.\n\n\nEXPLAIN COMPLEX FORMULAS\nIf you\u2019ve received a spreadsheet from a colleague and have no idea what the formulas do, you can use the \u201cExplain formula\u201d function, and it will tell you what the formula does in plain English.\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nThe Numerous.ai Chrome extension makes the experience of using the plugin faster and better. \nHere is a list of the extension's features:\n\nLAUNCH NUMEROUS FASTER\nThe Numerous.ai extension allows you to launch Numerous's Google Sheets plugin faster.

Hold down Shift as you mouse over elements on the page.

Repeat step (2) to close the console.\n\nIf the console gets in your way, hold down Shift and then move your mouse over it; it will move to the opposite side of the page.\n\nOne word of caution: When rendering HTML tables, Chrome inserts artificial <tbody> tags into the DOM, which will consequently show up in queries extracted by this extension.\n\nFull Credits to Adam Sadovsky (https://github.com/google/xpaf) for creating a great tool."

A JavaScript-enabled web page can access much of the browser's functionality, with little control over this process available to the user: malicious websites can uniquely identify you through fingerprinting and use other tactics for tracking your activity. JShelter aims to improve the privacy and security of your web browsing.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nLike a firewall that controls network connections, JShelter controls the APIs provided by the browser, restricting the data that they gather and send out to websites. JShelter adds a safety layer that allows the user to choose if a certain action should be forbidden on a site, or if it should be allowed with restrictions, such as reducing the precision of geolocation to the city area. This layer can also aid as a countermeasure against attacks targeting the browser, operating system or hardware.\n\nPlease see the FAQ (https://jshelter.org/faq/) and our blog (https://jshelter.org/blog/) for more information about the extension.\n\nWhat is the threat model?\n\nhttps://jshelter.org/threatmodel/\n\nCan I read a paper about the extension?\n\nYes, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01392\n\nNote that JShelter can also be used to learn the origin of the calls for JavaScript APIs that are often misused for browser fingerprinting with Fingerprint Detector report. The detected calls in a web page can be exported as JSON."

Do not show the availability of the slots for 24 hours after 3-5 checks or refreshes\n\nTo overcome all these hurdles and prevent being locked out by the visa portal just when needed the most, we, checkvisaslots.com with the help of fellow community members, who check for the visa availability slots, created this tool to share the availability of the slots when they log on to the US Visa appointment scheduling portal.\n\nImproved UX:\n1. Automatically navigates to the earliest slot date\n2. Keeps you ready to submit for an earliest time slot - you'll be one-click away to get a slot\n3. Show an overview of all available slots\n\nThe extension works for all 62 countries listed on https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-us/countries_list/niv"

A recent report revealed that a 12-character value comprised solely of numbers might be hacked in just 25 seconds. However, employing a strong random password generator to create a 12-character mix of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and symbols significantly elevates the complexity, extending the hacking time to an estimated 34,000 years. Thus, a sequences generated by a our solution offers a level of security that is virtually unbreachable within a human lifetime.\n\n\u2753 Can I reuse a secure password on multiple sites?\n\ud83d\udca1 Definitely not. Even a secure password isn't enough on its own. It's crucial to create a password that's unique for each site. This way, if one site experiences a breach and your access information is exposed, your other accounts on different sites remain secure.\n\n\u2753 I want to make a password out of special characters only, is it possible?\n\ud83d\udca1Yes, creating a special character password composed exclusively of symbols like !, @, #, $, etc., is possible and can be a strong security choice. Such a combination significantly complicates potential brute-force or guessing attacks due to the unpredictability and complexity of the symbols used.\n\n\ud83c\udd99 Updates:\nVersion 1.0.4: added a preset for 8 characters in the context menu"

It has 2 modes, Lite and Full. In lite mode, the extension uses the least amount of CPU power and memory and it runs based on pure CSS. Lite mode is ideal for slow machines. In full mode, more ads are targeted and more CPU power and memory are required.\n\nSome important features:\n\n1. It allows you to block annoying ads, scripts, images, iframes and many more.\n2. Ultra-lite extension with no significant memory and CPU usage.\n3. Unlike other similar products, AdBlocker Lite uses hard coded filtering rules for fast and reliable performance.\n4. Provides an easy access filtering list if you wish to allow advertisement on some websites.\n5. Includes ON|OFF  button to quickly disable or enable the extension.\n6. Includes Highlight/Block modes; in highlight mode, you can only highlight ads without blocking (hiding) them, but in block mode, ads are blocked.\n7. Easily switch between full and lite modes (default is lite mode).\n8. Add custom blocking rules. Currently, only rules in the form of css-selectors are accepted.\n9. Badge icon text shows the number of blocked ads (active in full mode only).\n\nNote 1: In AdBlocker Lite you can allow some websites (including its homepage) to show non-intrusive advertisements. By doing this you support websites that rely on advertising. Some websites are added by default, but this list can be modified at any time.\n\nNote 2: AdBlocker Lite is designed to block ads on popular websites only (i.e. facebook, youtube, gmail, yahoo mail, etc). Besides, it does not block popup-ads, if you need a full-featured adblocker please use other adblocker addons in the addon store.\n\nNote 3: To add a custom rule, please use css-selectors. For example, the following rule hides a div element with class test: div[class='test']. Please note, you can only add valid CSS rules, otherwise, it won't be added to the list."

Therefore, all the operations related to file storage are happening in the default download folder in your browser. If you want to change this folder, please head to the extensions tab in your browser, search for download settings and update the default folder to where you prefer.\n\nWord Editor is built on top of the famous TinyMCE JavaScript library (https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce). Once you open the app for the first time, you will see a blank screen with a toolbar on top. Simply type or paste your document, and at the end, click on the save button (File > Save) to download the document as an HTML file in your system (default download location).\n\nIf you have a feature request or found a bug to report, please fill the bug report form on the addon's homepage (https://mybrowseraddon.com/word-editor.html)."

This is a useful tool to find for instance the actual image name or detect whether this image is unique or is just a copy or a modified copy of an already existed image on the web.\n\nIn most cases, images are embedded in the background page and hence it is not straightforward to find the actual source of them to be passed to a reverse image search engine. Also, the image you are looking for maybe just part of a video stream. This extension solves these problems by providing a capturing tool in the right-click context menu. Simply select the item and capture a portion of the screen. The captured image is automatically sent to either \"TinEye\" or \"Google Images\" search engine, and after a successful upload, a new page with the matching results is displayed.\n\nThis extension adds three items to the context menu of your browser:\n1. Google Images (Image URL)\n2. Tineye (Image URL)\n3. Google Images (Capture)\n\nThe first two items are added to the image context menu, and the third one is added to the page context to activate the capturing tool. Instead of the third option, you can alternatively press the browser action button.\n\nLinks:\nFAQs Page: https://add0n.com/reverse-image-search.html\nGitHub Page: https://github.com/schomery/reverse-image-search/"

It doesn't know what a character is. ChatGPT counts content in tokens. ChatGPT has a context window of how many tokesn it can remember.\n\nOpenAI is hiding what the context window is on the web version. ChatGPT 4o in Plus and Team should have a context window of 32,768 tokens (~24,000 words). 3 words ~ 4 tokens. When your conversation becomes longer than that, ChatGPT will start to \"forget\" what was discussed earlier.\n\nThe box in the corner of the window lets you monitor the token usage and ensure that the conversations do not exceed the context window, which is particularly important for coaching, idea generation, and working with longer articles where retaining the context is crucial.\n\nWith this extension, you will know when context can be missing and will have more productive and meaningful conversations with ChatGPT.\n\nThis extension is written 99% by ChatGPT. The logo icon is created 100% by MidJourney.\n\nThe number IS NOT exact but should be in the range of +/- a dozen."

      "full_description": "Enhances WhatsApp Web with privacy features: disables file upload, paste, right-click, attachment button, and removes distractions.\n\nEnhance Security & Privacy with WhatsApp Web File Blocker: A Simple Solution for Organizations\n\nIn today\u2019s digital age, WhatsApp Web is a popular tool for communicating within organizations. While its convenience cannot be overstated, the ability to upload and download files on WhatsApp Web can pose significant security and privacy risks, especially when it comes to sensitive or confidential information. For organizations that wish to allow employees to use WhatsApp Web without compromising security, the WhatsApp Web File Blocker extension is the ideal solution.\n\nWhy Block File Uploads and Downloads on WhatsApp Web?\nOrganizations often face the challenge of balancing employee productivity with data security. Enabling WhatsApp Web usage in the workplace can be a great way to facilitate communication, but it also opens the door for the unauthorized sharing of files, documents, and other sensitive content. \n\nThis could lead to:\n1. Unintended Data Leaks: Files containing proprietary, personal, or confidential information could be inadvertently shared.\n2. Compliance Violations: For businesses in regulated industries, accidental sharing of sensitive data could violate compliance standards and regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific policies.\n3. Malware Risk: Shared files may include malicious attachments or links, posing a security threat to your network.\nBy blocking file uploads and downloads on WhatsApp Web, organizations can significantly reduce these risks while still allowing employees to use the communication platform for text-based interaction.\n\nKey Features of the WhatsApp Web File Blocker Extension\nThe WhatsApp Web File Blocker is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension that restricts all file-sharing capabilities on WhatsApp Web. \n\nWith this extension, organizations can:\n1. Block File Uploads: Prevent employees from uploading any files (documents, images, videos, etc.) to WhatsApp Web. This ensures that confidential data is not transferred outside the organization through personal chats or group messages.\n2. Disable File Downloads: Employees will be unable to download any files shared with them, protecting against unauthorized access to external documents, files, and media.\n3. Disable Drag and Drop Functionality: Employees will no longer be able to drag and drop files into WhatsApp Web, further preventing the accidental or intentional sharing of files.\n4. Maintain Messaging Functionality: The extension doesn\u2019t interfere with text-based messaging, allowing employees to continue using WhatsApp Web for communication, while maintaining the security of your organization's sensitive data.\n\nBenefits for Organizations\n1. Secure Communication: While employees can still communicate effectively through text messages, blocking file transfers ensures that no data is exchanged that could jeopardize company security.\n2. Compliance with Internal Policies: Many organizations have strict data handling policies. By using the WhatsApp Web File Blocker, companies can ensure that employees adhere to these rules, reducing the risk of policy violations.\n3. Safeguard Against External Threats: By blocking the sharing of files, the extension helps prevent the transfer of malicious files or malware through WhatsApp Web, reducing the chance of network breaches or system infections.\n4. Enhanced Productivity with Controlled Access: WhatsApp Web can remain a convenient tool for workplace communication, but with the extension in place, file-sharing capabilities are completely restricted. This gives companies more control over how employees use the platform, minimizing the risk of distractions or misuse.\n5. Seamless Deployment: The extension is easy to deploy across all workstations using Chrome, making it simple to roll out to your entire organization. There\u2019s no complex configuration needed, and it can be centrally managed by IT administrators.\n\nUse Cases for the WhatsApp Web File Blocker Extension\n1. Corporate Environments: Use WhatsApp Web for internal communication, but prevent employees from sharing files that could contain sensitive information.\n2. Educational Institutions: Allow students and faculty to communicate using WhatsApp Web while ensuring that no copyrighted or inappropriate materials are exchanged.\n3. Healthcare Providers: Ensure compliance with HIPAA and other privacy regulations by blocking the sharing of patient data and other sensitive documents.\n4. Financial Institutions: Prevent the sharing of sensitive financial reports, customer information, or confidential data to safeguard against data breaches.\n\nHow to Install and Use the WhatsApp Web File Blocker\n1. Download the Chrome Extension: Simply visit the Chrome Web Store and search for the WhatsApp Web File Blocker extension.\n2. Install the Extension: Click \"Add to Chrome\" and follow the on-screen instructions to install the extension.\n3. Activate the Extension: Once installed, the extension will automatically block all file uploads and downloads on WhatsApp Web, ensuring that your organization\u2019s data stays secure.\n\nConclusion: A Secure Solution for WhatsApp Web Usage in Your Organization\nAllowing employees to use WhatsApp Web can increase communication efficiency and foster collaboration, but it also comes with potential risks when it comes to file sharing. By using the WhatsApp Web File Blocker extension, your organization can safely enable WhatsApp Web access while preventing unauthorized file transfers.\n\nThis extension is an essential tool for any organization that wants to ensure compliance with data security policies, safeguard sensitive information, and mitigate the risks associated with file-sharing on WhatsApp Web."

You can use the extension to save links from your tabs and tab groups, articles, quotes from websites, and even RSS and Atom feeds.\n\n\u2605 Privacy\n\nThis extension has a detailed privacy policy which you can read on our website, but the gist of it is that your private data won't be sent to our servers unless you log in to our website. You can absolutely use this extension 100% locally, and even without an internet connection.\n\n\u2605 Save tabs and tab groups\n\nSaving tabs and tab groups is the primary feature of this extension. The extension can save and reopen any of your tabs and tab groups. You can also choose to close the tabs after saving. The extension will remember the names and colors of your tab groups as well as the links they contain, and restore them appropriately.\n\nWhile choosing which tabs to save, you can select the current tab, everything except the current tab, everything to the left or right of the current tab, tabs you've highlighted, or just specific tabs you've selected within the extension. The extension allows you to choose tabs from specific windows as well.\n\n\u2605 Save articles\n\nThis extension empowers you to save articles from the web. The extension contains a polished article reader which not only allows you to read content from the web, but to edit that content. The article editor is a full rich text editor with the ability to add notes, highlight text, and apply complex text styling. You can apply all of the traditional text styles like bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough, as well as more complex styling constructs like lists, block quotes, links, and headers. If you've saved an article which contains source code, the article reader will even apply syntax highlighting with support for most popular programming languages!\n\n\u2605 Save quotes\n\nThe extension can save quotes from websites. Just select a passage of text on a website, right click, and then click 'Save Selected Text'. The extension will save the selected text, as well as a text fragment link. When you click the link in a browser that supports text fragments, it'll take you to the original website and visually highlight the text you saved.\n\n\u2605 Feeds\n\nThe extension can notify you if it finds an RSS or Atom feed on the current page (by updating the extension's icon with the number of feeds found). If you save a feed, the extension will fetch new links from the feed in the background, and you can choose to save or delete any of the fetched links.\n\n\u2605 Sort by site, tag, or time period\n\nWant to find all of your saved data from a specific site, or annotated with a specific tag? This extension allows you to filter your data based on specific sites and tags, as well as view your data chronologically in a calendar view.\n\n\u2605 Search\n\nThe extension supports fast full-text search, which you can access quickly from within the extension popup with a keyboard shortcut.\n\n\u2605 Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nYou can open the extension by holding Command + Shift + O on a Mac or Ctrl + Shift + O in any other operating system. Once the extension popup is open, you can use shortcuts to:\n\n- Save All Tabs\n- Save the Current Tab\n- Save Everything Except the Current Tab\n- Save an Article\n- Search\n- Open the extension popup in a new tab\n- Toggle Privacy Mode\n\n\u2605 Sharing\n\nSecurely and privately share your data with friends! Click the settings icon next to any collection of saved data to share that collection with others. The extension will generate a shareable url which compresses the data and appends it to the hash portion of the url. When you (or someone else) open the link in your browser, the page's code will decompress the data and present it to you. Data stored in the hash portion of a url is never sent to external servers by web browsers, which means only the people you share the link with will ever have access to that data."

Focus blocks non-educational websites, so students focus on success.\n\nFocus by Freedom helps you stay focused on your work or schoolwork. Focus blocks distracting websites, while allowing you access to the sites you need. Focus lets you do better work in less time.\n\n\nTHE CHALLENGE \n\nDo you work or study on your computer? \n\nThen you\u2019ve been distracted by news, social media, shopping, email.  These distractions lead you to drift off-task, waste time, and end up unproductive and unfulfilled.  We\u2019ve all been there. \n\nThe temptation of opening a new browser tab  to find a new distraction is strong and the action is often compulsive. \n\nWe all have specific sites that are our go-to distractions, but we also know that anything we click has the potential to become a distraction. except for the tools we\u2019re using to get our work or studying done.\n\nTHE ANSWER \n\nFocus by Freedom blocks only those distracting websites so that you can focus on your work or studies. You tell Focus what sites you do need for work or schoolwork, and it will block everything else. You\u2019ll stay focused and on-task, while doing high quality work because of your sustained attention. What\u2019s more, you\u2019ll find you can get more done in less time without those constant online interruptions!\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nFocus by Freedom blocks websites by placing them behind a PIN.  \n\nEASY SETUP \u2013 create a PIN (a password) and decide which websites should be allowed\nCUSTOMIZABLE - Focus comes pre-populated with an Allow List of common work and learning sites. You can customize as needed. \nACCOUNTABILITY - A parent can set the PIN for children, or you can have  your spouse or friend set the PIN for you\n\nWHO SHOULD USE FOCUS? \n\n- Remote workers, from home or in hybrid working situations \n- Students doing homework\n- Students with online or remote learning \n- Writers, Teachers, Entrepreneurs, Editors, Researchers, Journalists, and Developers all use Focus to get their work done!\n\nFocus is a product of Freedom Labs, where we develop new ways to meaningfully interact with technology.  Like our other extensions, Focus is highly privacy-conscious. None of your data is sent anywhere (the cloud, our servers, etc.) It remains secure on your own device. You can learn more about Freedom here: https://freedom.to\n\nRelease notes: Focus 1.0.3 fixes two issues:\n\n- Sometimes, the extension disables itself automatically and bypasses the green screen when visiting a blocked website\n- Sometimes, when adding a new website to the allowed list, it does add it, but it's not shown in the list\n\n Please send us your feedback at support@freedom.to and we'll continue to improve Focus.  Thank you!"

I got tired of constant distractions from ads, spoilers, and irrelevant content, so I made this to create a cleaner, more focused browsing experience. Just type in the keywords you don't want yo see and ElementHider takes care of the rest. \n\nFeatures\n * Hide by Keyword: This is the main feature. You can automatically hide any content that contains specific words or phrases you define. It's a powerful way to filter out spoilers or topics you aren't interested in.\n\n * Hide Anything Else: If a keyword isn't enough, you can also use a point and click method to hide any individual element on the page, like a sidebar, an ad, or a \"suggested for you\" box.\n\n * Blur Instead of Hide: If you don't want to completely remove content, blur it instead. Just hover over the blurred area to reveal it when you're ready.\n\n * Extension is built to hide unwanted content, even on dynamic sites like social media feeds where new content loads as you scroll.\n\n * Customizable Site-Specific Rules: For more control, you can apply rules to specific websites only. Use a safe test mode to highlight what will be hidden before it disappears. You can also adjust hiding sensitivity and set keywords to be case-insensitive or exact match.\n\nElementHider was designed to work on any website, including YouTube, X (Twitter), Facebook, news sites, and shopping sites.\n\nExtension permissions are required to read the sites to detect the elements and keywords on the site but no data is collected or sent to the developer or any 3rd party. All the data (keywords, settings) are saved into your Chrome sync storage so everything stays within Chrome and your Google account."

      "full_description": "Downloads Also Bought, Also Viewed and Also Read data, as well as Top 100s and Hot New Releases from the Amazon Kindle Store\n\nThis extension lets you download:\n\n - Lists of titles shown on a particular book details page in the Kindle Store.  These may be 'Also Bought', 'Also Viewed', 'Books you may like', 'Products related to this item' or other names.\n - Top 100 and Hot New Releases lists for an Amazon category page\n - Search results (US store only right now, but other stores will be added soon)\n\nSelf-published authors on the Amazon Kindle Store can use this information to identify books similar to their own titles for research purposes.  Currently the extension works on the US, UK, DE and Canada Amazon stores, but I'll look at adding support for others in future.\n\nWhen the extension is loaded, you should see a button with a download icon appear next to the title lists ('carousels') in a Kindle Store book details page, as well as the Top 100s and Hot New Releases for a category, or the search results.  Different pages may have one or more of these at different times and in different places, so if you don't see them, try another book, or the same book at another time.  \n\nTo use the extension, click the button.  You should see each page in the carousel load in turn, and when the end is reached, you should get a popup to download the file, or see the file automatically downloaded (depending on your browser settings).  \n\n*Just added*: support for downloading cover montages as well!  When you download the book data, you'll get another prompt asking if you want to 'download multiple files'.  Click 'Allow' and you'll get a JPEG file with a montage of all the covers for the book data you've downloaded.  This can be really helpful to get an idea of cover conventions within a genre.\n\nBook information is in a tab-delimited text file you can open in any spreadsheet program, and includes the following:\n\nASIN\t\nTitle\t\nSeries\t\nAuthor\t\nNumber of Reviews\nAverage review \nPrice\t\nURL to book details page\n\nNote: working out the series name isn't always easy. We can handle most common formats like 'Book Title (Series Name Book <x>)', but I have learned that there's a much bigger range of formats out there than I realised.   If the series name can't be identified, then it just throws up its hands and dumps the whole thing into the Title field, which you can search on anyway.\n\nBook formats are always changing, and so this extension might break if it encounters a new one it can't handle.  If this happens, please drop me an email at <nat@kindletrends.com> with the details of the book on which it happened, and I'll do what I can to resolve it.\n\nPermissions required for the extension to work are because it adds a 'download' button to the Kindle Store book details page. Always exercise caution when downloading files from the Internet."

This extension also blocks WebRTC IP detection to prevent your real IP address to leak.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Improves the user's privacy by hiding the real IP address\n2.

Configures WebRTC to not reveal private IP addresses when the extension is active. This is an optional feature.\n4. It is possible to request a new identity (new IP) right from the extension whenever needed.\n5. There is no conflict with other running instances of Tor (like Tor Browser). This extension uses its unique communication port.\n\nNotes:\nFor this extension to run the Tor executable, you will need to install a NodeJS native client. This is a bridge connector to allow the extension to execute Tor. You will get a notification on the first use to install this native client.\n\nPlease read FAQ #1 on the homepage of the extension to prepare the extension to use the Tor executable. For now, the Tor bundle is prepared for Mac OS and Windows. On Linux, install the tor as usual and set the path on the options page."

(Originally is hard to get back to abstract page from PDF page)\n- Add a direct download link on abstract page, click it to download the PDF with the title as filename. (Originally is paper id as filename)\n- Open the paper in extra services such as ar5iv and arXiv Vanity.\n- Better title even for bookmarks!\n- Firefox has strict restrictions on PDF.js. So it doesn't work well with OneTab, the PDF renaming is achieved by intercepting requests and show the PDF in a container. The bookmark works well though.\n- Works well with native tab search\n\nPermissions:\n\n- `tabs`: On extension button click, open a new tab and move it to the right of the old active tab.\n- `activeTab`: Read active tab's title and modify it using the tab's url.\n- `storage`: Save extension configurations.\n- `contextMenus`: When right-click the extension button, show a help menu item.\n- `scripting`: Inject content scripts to existing tabs.\n- `*://arxiv.org/*`: Inject content scripts to existing tabs.\n- `*://export.arxiv.org/*`: Inject content scripts to existing tabs.\n- `*://browse.arxiv.org/*`: Inject content scripts to existing tabs.\n- `*://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/*`: Inject content scripts to existing tabs."

OVERVIEW\n2. HOW TO USE IT\n3. TO-DO\n4. VERSION HISTORY \n\n--------------------\n\n1. OVERVIEW\n\nOnce you install the extension (and reload your page), clicking the red target in the extension pane will open a pop-up.\n\nIn this pop-up, you can choose which listener to activate on the page. \n\nClick Listener: Halts default action of all clicks on the document node, pushes gtm.click and other data into debugDL upon clicking on the page.\n\nLink Click Listener: Halts default action of all clicks on the document node, pushes gtm.linkClick and other data into debugDL upon clicking any link element on the page.\n\nForm Submit Listener: Halts default action of all form submissions, pushes gtm.formSubmit and other data into debugDL upon submitting a form.\n\nBy choosing the listener and clicking \"Switch On\" you set up the listener on the page. By opening the pop-up and clicking \"Switch Off\", you cancel all extension actions.\n\nOnce an event is pushed into the debugDL array, a small badge icon in the Browser Action increases in count, signifying the number of items in the array. To view contents of the array, open the JavaScript console in your Chrome browser and type \"debugDL\" (without quotes).\n\nIf your page has jQuery available, you can kill all jQuery binds by clicking the respective button. This is to test if jQuery is interfering with GTM listeners.\n\nThe debugger is tab-specific, so actions in a tab are for that tab only. Once you browse away from the page, debugDL will not be available any more.\n\nNote that canceling the default action of clicks and submits is not 100 % accurate. You might have interfering scripts which make it so that redirection or submission happens anyway.\n\n2. HOW TO USE IT\n\nThe idea is that you can test how different elements perform with these three GTM listeners without actually setting up a real GTM listener. This is good for debugging, as you can now test freely with your markup before setting up listener tags in GTM. This is also very useful if you want to debug a site where you don't have access to the container or a preview version.\n\n3. TO-DO\n\n1) Make more stable and robust\n\n4. VERSION HISTORY\n\nv1.4 - May 13, 2020\n- Fixed Click Listener to be properly removed when extension is inactive.\n- Switched to using just the activeTab permission.\n\nv1.3 - June 5, 2015\n- Changed Click Listener to use Capture\n- Changed Link Click Listener to climb through DOM tree until a link is found\n\nv1.2 - June 1, 2014\n- Added a badge icon which increases in count every time an event is pushed into debugDL\n- Improved the pop-up instructions\n- If the extension doesn't work, an error message will be displayed in the pop-up\n- Changed the name of the extension to GTM Sonar (thanks Paul Gailey for the idea!)\n\nv1.1 - May 26, 2014\n- Added a popup to control debugger functions\n- Added a switch to kill all jQuery binds\n- Added the choice of Click Listener, Link Click Listener and Form Submit Listener\n\nv1.0 - May 23, 2014\n- First release version\n- Clicking the Browser Action halts all click events and sets up the debugDL object\n- Clicking anywhere on the page stores the gtm.click event in debugDL\n- Clicking the Browser Action again removes all scripts and event handlers injected by this extension"

Meet the Productivity Owl.\n\nThe owl is very strict.  He will berate and mock you.  You'll be forced to complete tasks to earn break time.  If you do consistent work, use the timeboxing scheduler for work/vacation, and complete the owl's psychological exercises then you might be able to earn the owl's respect.  \n\nJust like the first version, the owl has 3 types of websites: Allowed, Blocked and Countdown.  If a website is not on the allowed/blocked lists, you'll get a certain amount of time to get the information you need before the owl closes the tab.  You can still use the scheduler to schedule free-time, and now you can also schedule work time.  Version 2.0 introduced a task manager, and you get rewarded break minutes for each task you complete.  There are also psychological interventions and browsing statistics in this version.   \n\nAlthough it is technically possible to earn the owl's respect - it's  highly unlikely.  The owl is very judgmental.  It may take years before anyone earns the owl's \"ultimate respect.\"  Of course if you uninstall the extension or disable it, all respect is lost.  \n\n***************  APACHE 2.0 LICENSE OPEN SOURCE ***************\nSince this extension is on every webpage you visit, I wanted to let everyone know there are NO TRACKERS or DATA COLLECTORS in the owl.  The owl is 100% open source.  You can view the source code on Github:  https://github.com/mrieck/productivityowl\n\n*Thanks to everyone who has been using the Productivity Owl over the years.  He's been helping me be productive for the last 15 years.  Hope he can help you too."

      "full_description": "Bulk delete photos from Google Photos\n\n# Google Photos Delete Tool\n\n## What is Google Photos Delete Tool?\n\nGoogle Photos Delete Tool is a powerful Chrome extension designed to help you efficiently manage and clean up your Google Photos library. It automates the process of selecting and deleting multiple photos, saving you time and effort when you need to remove a large number of images from your account.\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Bulk Selection**: Automatically selects multiple photos at once, streamlining the deletion process.\n2. **Customizable Deletion Limit**: Set a maximum number of photos to delete in one session (default is 10,000).\n3. **Automatic Scrolling**: Navigates through your photo library automatically, ensuring all photos are considered for deletion.\n4. **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time updates on the number of photos selected and deleted.\n5. **Error Handling**: Robust error management to ensure smooth operation even if issues occur.\n6. **User-Initiated**: The deletion process only starts when you click the extension icon, giving you full control.\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Smart Selection**: The tool uses advanced selectors to identify and select photos in your Google Photos interface.\n2. **Batch Processing**: Photos are selected and deleted in batches for improved efficiency.\n3. **Confirmation Handling**: Automatically confirms deletion actions, saving you from repetitive clicking.\n4. **Scrolling Logic**: Implements intelligent scrolling to load more photos as needed.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\n\n- Clearing out old or unwanted photos in bulk\n- Managing storage space in your Google Photos account\n- Streamlining your photo collection after a large import\n- Quickly removing duplicate or similar images\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. Install the Google Photos Delete Tool extension from the Chrome Web Store.\n2. Navigate to [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com).\n3. Click on the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar.\n4. The tool will automatically start selecting and deleting photos based on the default settings.\n5. Monitor the progress through console logs (accessible via Chrome DevTools).\n6. The process will continue until it reaches the set limit or runs out of photos to delete.\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can customize the tool's behavior by modifying the `CONFIG` object in the extension's code:\n\n- `maxCount`: Set the maximum number of photos to delete in one session.\n- `timeout`: Adjust the maximum wait time for operations.\n- `scrollDelay`: Fine-tune the delay between scrolling actions.\n\n## Important Notes and Warnings\n\n1. **Use with Caution**: This tool performs bulk deletions. Make sure you want to delete the selected photos before starting the process.\n2. **Permanent Deletion**: Deleted photos will be moved to the Google Photos Trash. They will be permanently deleted after 60 days unless manually restored.\n3. **Account-Wide Action**: The tool operates on your entire Google Photos library. It doesn't target specific albums or date ranges.\n4. **Performance Impact**: Running this tool may temporarily slow down your browser due to the intensive nature of bulk operations.\n5. **Network Dependency**: A stable internet connection is required for optimal performance.\n6. **UI Changes**: If Google updates the Photos interface, the tool may require updates to maintain compatibility.\n\n## Privacy and Data Security\n\n- This extension operates entirely within your browser and Google Photos interface.\n- It does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or photos.\n- No external servers are accessed during the deletion process.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- Works with the latest version of Google Chrome.\n- Designed for the English version of Google Photos.\n- May work with other Chromium-based browsers, but this is not officially supported.\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Cannot target specific date ranges or albums for deletion.\n- Does not provide options for selective deletion based on criteria like file size or image content.\n- The tool's efficiency may vary based on your internet speed and computer performance.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n\n1. Refresh the Google Photos page and try again.\n2. Ensure you're using the latest version of Chrome and the extension.\n3. Check that you're on the English version of Google Photos.\n4. Clear your browser cache and cookies related to Google Photos.\n5. If problems persist, uninstall and reinstall the extension.\n\n## Support and Feedback\n\nWe value your input and are committed to improving the Google Photos Delete Tool.

Preview of photos selected for deletion\n4. Undo functionality for accidental deletions\n5.

      "full_description": "Discover the best way to learn a new language while watching your favorite movies and series on Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+.\n\nFluentAI \u2013 AI-Powered Dual-Subtitle Language Learning Extension\n\n\nFluentAI turns movies and videos into interactive language lessons. It overlays dual subtitles (original + translation) on Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and other platforms, so you read and learn simultaneously. Every word is clickable: instant translations, definitions, example sentences, and grammar analysis appear in a popup just like a built-in dictionary. This immersive approach follows the trend of other tools (e.g., Language Reactor, Lingopie) that emphasize \u201cNetflix dual subtitles\u201d and interactive vocabulary. FluentAI goes further by using AI to support all languages (no hard-coded list) and syncing subtitles precisely with the audio.\n\nKey Features:\n\n * Dual Bilingual Subtitles: Works on Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, HBO Max, etc., showing original and translated subtitles together. Instantly look up any subtitle word (click or tap) to get translations, pronunciation, and usage examples.\n\n * AI-Powered Translation & Grammar: Unlike simple subtitle-only tools, FluentAI uses AI to translate any language and analyze grammar. Clicking a word also reveals grammar notes and contextual explanations (similar to Lingopie\u2019s AI grammar feature). Sentence breakdowns and AI grammar help make even complex lines easy to understand.\n\n * Integrated Vocabulary Notebook & Flashcards: Save words or entire phrases with one click. FluentAI automatically creates smart flashcards (with audio and example sentences) and lets you export them (e.g., to Anki). A built-in notebook organizes saved words with filters and tracks which words you\u2019ve learned (feature-comparable to Migaku\u2019s flashcard system).\n\n * Custom Playback Modes: Learning modes like Pause Mode (auto-pause on new words), Voice-Repeat Mode (listen and repeat with AI voice), and Resume Mode help match the video to your study pace. There\u2019s even speed-control and looping to focus on tricky phrases.\n\n * Customizable Subtitle Display: Adjust subtitle font, color, size, position, opacity, and background blur. Support for lifelike text-to-speech means FluentAI can read any subtitle out loud in a natural voice \u2013 handy for pronunciation practice.\n\n * Full-Length, Multi-Language Support: Thanks to AI, FluentAI works on full movies or series in any language, without pre-built subtitle sets. Whether it\u2019s Spanish telenovelas or Korean dramas, FluentAI generates dual subtitles on-the-fly. (Competitor tools like Trancy support many sites and languages, and FluentAI matches that flexibility.)\n\n * Progress Tracking & Statistics: FluentAI keeps statistics on your learning \u2013 how many words you\u2019ve saved, practiced, or mastered. Use these analytics to see your improvement over time (a feature missing in basic subtitle extensions).\n\nComparison with Other Extensions:\n\nFluentAI includes all the core tools of the popular language-learning players and adds extra AI enhancements:\n\n * Language Reactor (a.k.a. \u201cLanguage Learning with Netflix\u201d): Offers dual subtitles on Netflix plus a popup dictionary. FluentAI matches these (covering Netflix and much more) and adds AI-synced subtitles and interactive word analysis on YouTube, Disney+, etc.\n\n * Lingopie: Provides smooth bilingual subtitles and clickable word lookups with AI grammar help. FluentAI offers the same instant translation and grammar insights on subtitles, but extends them to all streaming/video sites and languages.\n\n * Migaku: Known for its powerful flashcard creation and tracking. FluentAI likewise lets you create flashcards from any video subtitle and export decks (e.g., to Anki), while also providing more playback-learning modes.\n\n * Trancy: Supports bilingual subs on YouTube/Netflix and has AI text translation for web content. FluentAI\u2019s focus is on video, but it also handles any site text. On videos, FluentAI provides similar bilingual subtitles plus advanced modes (pause, voice-repeat) not found in Trancy.\n\nBy combining these features, FluentAI becomes a one-stop solution: Netflix dual subtitles, YouTube dual subtitles, plus interactive word definitions, grammar breakdowns, example sentences, and smart flashcard tools \u2013 all in one extension.\n\nTry, you\u2019ll like it."

Just one click before submitting your form when you are not sure, is enough. This is also helpful to check if caps lock is active or you have currently selected another input language.\n\n- You no longer type wrong passwords when creating or registering for a new account. This saves your time and possibly avoids any headache.\n\n\nNew in v1.2:\n- Major bug that caused the extension to stop working is now fixed\n\nFor questions, reports, feedback, support or anything related to SHP contact us at hidev.chrome@gmail.com"

      "full_description": "This extension gives you the ability to customize how your Google search results look like.\n\nWhat does this extension do?\n\nThis extension allows you to customize how your Google Search results are displayed. You can:\n\n    Remove, Move, Color the link of the webpage in the search result.\n    Remove, Make the Ads stand out(make ad more obvious, make ad really obvious).\n    Remove Emojis from titles and descriptions of search results.\n    Remove other stuff Google inserts in the search results(\u201cPeople also ask\u201d, \u201cTop News\u201d, \u2026).\n    Remove \"AI Overview\" from serach results.\n\n\n\nWhy I made it?\n\nSome time ago Google changed how their search results appear. Ads use to be obvious compared to regular search results.\n\nAfter the update, it is way harder to tell the difference between an ad and a genuine search result. What Google is trying to do here is increase the CTR for their ads by trying to blend them in with the regular search results.\n\nCompared to how Google Search results looked years ago there are now fewer results per page and the pages contain a bunch of other clutter that you might or might not find useful.\n\nI don\u2019t really appreciate how they have changed the search results in the past years. If you don\u2019t either you can use this extension I made to clean them up.\n\nI didn\u2019t make this extension for profit. As mentioned above I made this extension because I didn\u2019t appreciate the new look of the Google search results and I knew there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t either.\n\nI also thought this would be a good opportunity to learn how to make a web browser extension and document the progress on my blog(You can find source code my Github page). The extension is free and will continue to remain so. Feel free to copy any of the code or fork the project and make your own version of the extension with other/different features.\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Guarantees\n\nThe extension doesn\u2019t collect any information at all. It only saves the setting you choose in the extension and saves it in your browser(Feel free to look at the code.).\n\nI make no guarantees that this extension will be without bugs or that I will keep updating it. Bugs can be reported on the projects Github page."

You can then create activities and QA them using preview links.\n- Mobile Viewports are supported without the Enhanced Experience Composer (EEC).\n- Customers new to Target can use the extension to experiment with Target even if their IT developers have not yet implemented Target on their websites.\n- Partners servicing multiple customers' websites and Target accounts now have one simple mechanism to support VEC loading, instead of managing multiple rules in third-party tools.\n- With Chrome 80's change in the default behaviour of SameSite attribute for cookies.\n     - Adobe Target - Visual Enhanced Composer functionality is fixed by adding the SameSite attribute to certain session cookies used by Adobe Target components.\n    - Clients are now able to set the SameSite attribute to the value \"None\" for their own session cookies in order for them to be able to login while using VEC or EEC."

Closing that story it will take me back to my RSS reader.\n\n2. If I queue up a bunch of stories to read by middle-clicking several links, they will all open on the end of the tab list. When I go to read them by clicking on the first tab I opened, closing it will show me the next story.\n\nI recognize how incredibly small the audience is for this exact setup, but there you have it.\n\nAttributions\nI used to just locally comment out some code in Brad Dwyer's Modified Tab Ordering extension from https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/lhlppppejjiiinhklmlpfkafimagbcbe - but Chrome now considers changes to be security issues.\n\nSince Brad's extension uses a deprecated version of the Chrome extension API, I based my version off of itworks' New Tabs At End from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tabs-at-end/bgogjfbkjgjhonhikkkflpkgpcpfljoa \n\nDouble Arrow glyph made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com licensed under CC BY 3.0"

      "full_description": "BrainTool is the best Bookmarks and Tabs Manager for your online life.\n\nTab Tamer, Bookmark Banisher, Task Tracker. Searcher, Finder, Saver. Level up your browser productivity workflow with BrainTool. Open Source, usable free, plain text notes, to-do management and more.\n\nYour BrainTool data is private, it's your personal information space. Back it up, copy it, share it - it's just a text file that you own.\n\nTame your browser, focus your attention and never be afraid to close a tab again!\n\nOrganize all your bookmarks, web resources, notes and to-do's into a personal Topic hierarchy and control your browser with the BrainTool Topic Manager. Open and close browser tabs, windows and tab groups with a click, or navigate using powerful keyboard commands. Capture links, notes and tasks while in context on a web page. Allocate each of your Topics to its own window or tab group for a focused workspace.\n\nThe BrainTool application reads from a plain text file completely under your control. It's written in the popular Org-Mode format and so can fit within any larger text-based workflow.\n\nImport from bookmarks, Org files or other extensions, sync automatically to Google Drive or a local file. BrainTool is 100% browser based, so your data never leaves your control.\n\nBrainTool is hard to summarize. Its a way-better bookmarks manager, but it also helps you manage your browser tabs, tabgroups, windows, tasks and sessions.  It's a personal knowledge management system that allows you to organize all of your online information sources (web sites, Google docs, gmails, files, photos, Slack channels, social media groups, code repos, wiki pages, task backlogs, Jupyter notebooks, LLM chat sessions, etc etc etc), combine them with your TODO's and text-based notes and see the big picture in the tree structured side panel.\n\n-------  RELEASE NOTES  --------\n# BrainTool 1.3\nThree major improvements:\n- Drag and Drop from web pages into the topic tree. Drag individual links or selected text including multiple links and drop under a topic in the tree. With a single link any associated text is added as a note. When text contains multiple links all are added under the topic.\n- \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f TRASH special topic. Deleted items are moved under Trash rather than immediately deleted from the tree.\n- \ud83d\udd16 BOOKMARKS BAR special topic. This topic is kept in sync with the items in your browser bookmarks bar. Changes made in the tree are updated to the browser and vice-versa.\n\n#BrainTool 1.2.6\nBookmarker now checks the backing store file for external changes before allowing a save.\n\n#BrainTool 1.2.5\nAdded support for dragging from the url bar into the topic manager to add a tab\n\n# BrainTool 1.2.2\nAdded filtering to show just TODOs or just show matching search results.\n\n# BrainTool 1.2\nAdded the ability to run the Topic Manager in the browsers side panel. It kind-of feels like BT has been pulled inside the browser!\n\n#BrainTool 1.1\nAutomatic local backups for recent, daily and monthly changes. Also:\n- Improved scrolling and arrow key support for search and row navigation.\n- Removed/defaulted settings for Sticky tabs and Tab Groups\n- Removed Notes toggle, replaced with resize control.\n- Improved discoverability of Supporter purchase buttons\n- Added uninstall feedback survey\n- bug fixes, performance improvements\n\n# BrainTool 1.0.3\nMinor release addressing some bugs and UI feedback.\n- Improved handling of dragging tabs between tabgroups and windows.\n- Added 'w' as a keyboard command for 'open in new Window'.\n- Improved handling of screen configuration changes.\n\n# BrainTool 1.0.2\n- Added topic expansion on hover so folded topics can be dropped into (thanks @rocketman455 for the suggestion!)\n- Improvements to the upgrade process to make it clearer whats happening.\n- Added trial expiration and initial nagging 30 days after installation.\n- GitHub #32: When TopicMgr is in a tab - don't navigate on item deletion. If the browser is maximized don't adjust its position on first opening TM.\n\n# BrainTool 1.0!\nHere is an overview of whats new.\n## Manifest V3\nThis change is not of great interest to a BT user but is mandated by Google and required non-trivial code changes.\n\n## Full Tab Group Support\nFull synchronization between Topics and browser tabgroups. By default Topics are now shown as tabgroups in the browser. Tabs opened from BT open in a tabgroup labelled with the appropriate Topic. In the Topic Manager open links and Topics are highlighted with the tabgroups color. Changing the tabgroups color in the browser is reflected in the Topic Manager. Name changes and expand/collapse operations are also synced.\n\nAdditionally dragging a tab into a tabgroup will save that tab into the Topic in BT. Dragging a saved tab out of its tabgroup will remove it from BrainTool.\n\n## Sticky Tabs\nWhen 'Sticky Tabs' is enabled the relationship between a tab and an associated saved item in the Topic Manager is maintained when you click a link in the saved tab or during a server side redirection. This allows you to navigate around a saved site or app, or get redirected to a different url (for example to a log-in page) while staying in the context of the original saved BT Item.\n\n## Topic Tree visuals\nThe expand/collapse buttons and the favicon displays have been restyled, and an empty topic is now visually distinct. These changes make the tree structure easier to see, in addition to improving the styling in general.\n\n## Session saving and Bookmarker Updates\nThe BT Bookmarker now has the option to save a whole tabgroup. When saving a session, tab groups are saved as the corresponding BrainTool Topic. Any ungrouped tabs are put in a tabgroup named with a Window-N prefix and saved under a Topic with the same name in the Topic Manager. The Session itself is given a Session-date Topic name and saved under the Topic selected in the Bookmarker or the Scratch default Topic.\n\n## Preferences for Dense, Hide Notes, Tooltips and Large Font\n\n## New Introductory Screens\nWe've added a helpful BrainTool Buddy to give a gentle introduction to BT when it's initially installed and at launch thereafter, until turned off.\n\n## GDrive Auth Change\nAnother Google mandated update is the change to use their Auth 2.0 libraries for Google Drive authorization. Unfortunately the access provided to browser-based apps (ie those without a back-end server) is considered to be temporary access and to require explicit user interaction. If you have GDrive saving turned on you'll be warned in the red warning banner when the token expires. You can click to immediately re-auth or ignore it and re-auth will happen on the next save.\n\n## Usability Improvements\n- Rows in the Topic Manager can now be dragged by selecting anywhere on the row\n- The Tab key now iterates a selected Topic through three states: collapsed, open with its child nodes showing and open with its children all fully expanded.\n- Search has been improved to make it easier to see the current match and other visible matches.\n\n## Pricing and License Changes for 1.0\n- There will be no limits on numbers of nodes saved in BT (other than those due to browser storage limits)\n- In addition to monthly and yearly subscriptions a one-time purchase lifetime license will be offered with pricing as follows:\n  - Monthly $1.33/mo, Yearly $10.66/yr, Lifetime $21\n  - This (low, low) pricing reflects my goal of having BT be widely used and to encourage users to support its development. The extra change over $1/$10/$20 covers the Stripe transaction costs.\n- License enforcement will be as follows:\n  - 30 days all access.\n  - After 30 days messages of gentle encouragement will be shown at intervals.\n  - Functionally some setting preferences will be locked (Dark mode, Favicons etc) but otherwise the app will be fully functional.\n\n# 0.9.9a\nThis was a minor point release because there are no changes requiring updates on the Web Stores, but it has some major functionality!\n\n## Local File Sync\nLocal file sync opens up a lot of potential for saving, versioning and backing up your BrainTool data. The file location used by BrainTool can be hooked up to DropBox, a git repository or any other cloud syncing mechanism.\n\nLocal sync is mutually exclusive with GDrive syncing, you can only sync to one place. Syncing can be turned on via the Settings screen (click the new Settings icon, top right). If you are already syncing to GDrive and want to change you will first need to turn off GDrive syncing (via 'Actions', again top right). On initiation you will be asked to select a folder for BT to access. The browser will ask you to grant permission first for Read-only access to the folder and then for read-write access.\n\nThe ability to write to a local file from a web app is a newish capability and heavily secured within the browser. Every time you re-open the BT Topic Manager you will need to re-grant permissions for BT to write to the local folder. Note that the **Brave** browser developers need to enable via a browser configuration setting.\n\n## Settings, Actions and Help panels\nThe previous overlay panel put access to settings behind multiple mouse clicks and was confusing for many users. We've broken out those functions into separate panels which can be accessed directly from the top level Topic Manager. Settings and Actions are top right, Help is bottom right. Other than Local file sync, the available settings and actions are unchanged.\n\n## Tips, Messages and Warnings\nA colored panel below the topic tree now shows any required informational messages on startup and subsequently provides access to a set of tips on BT usage. If a sync file is out of date the panel shows a 'Warning' message and provides a shortcut to the refresh function with a single click.\n\n## Minor UI changes\n- Some colors have been tweaked to improve contrast and readability.\n- The application as a whole now does a better job of handling wide and narrow Topic Manager windows.\n- The topic card editor makes better use of space and use a fixed width font to improve org-mode compatibility.\n\n## Telemetry\nWhile your privacy is a key aspect of the BrainTool value proposition and we do not have any access to your data, we do need to collect some information on how the application itself is being used. On startup the app now records (to Google Analytics) the number of saved topics and pages, the number of file saves/updates, the number of tab operations performed, the number of times you've launched the app, days since install and how long your last session of using it was.\n\n# BrainTool 0.9.9\n## New Look and Feel including a Dark Mode\n\n## Re-organized Saver Tool\nAnother iteration on whats been called the bookmarker or popup to make it easier to understand while keeping it fast and efficient for both mouse and keyboard users. Additionally, any number of nested new topics can now be created from the Saver e.g. setting the topic to Animal:Vertebrate:Mammal:Carnivore:Canid:Dog:Hound:Beagle will create 8 levels of topic if they don't already exist.\n\n## Compact Mode\nAnother highly requested feature. Shrinking the Topic Manager to less than 350 pixels wide hides the notes column for a highly compact and information dense display of your saved topics and pages.\n\n## \"Open in New Window\" Tool\nYou can now open a page, or complete topic, in a new window. The previous mapping of topics to windows has been removed as being too complicated. You can choose to have BT manage your tabs, grouping them into tab groups, or not, thus leaving them wherever you or the browser puts them. BT will no longer confuse you by moving tabs between windows.\n\n## \"Add Top Level Topic\" Tool\nAvailable at the top of the Topic Manager. Hopefully this one is self-explanatory.\n\n## Topic Manager window remembers its position\nThe Topic Manager now opens with the same size and position as it had when it was last closed.\n\n## GDrive Refresh Button\nIf you have GDrive syncing turned on, the Refresh button is now available in the top toolbar whenever BT detects that there is a newer file available.\n\n## Topic Tree imports\nA correctly formatted org-mode file will now import its contents into the appropriate nesting in the tree. See https://braintool.org/topicTrees.\n\n## Other Usability and Misc Improvements\nRemoved the counter for number of saves (top right) because its no longer part of the pricing model. Lots of improvements were made in areas like the card editor, the initial topic tree, the initial placement of the topic manager etc.\n\n#  BrainTool 0.9.8\n## New Bookmarker\nRe-designed it from the ground up.\n\n## Skip the Topic!\nBy popular demand added a 'Scratch' topic.\n\n## Update existing note cards in the Bookmarker\nAdded the ability to edit the notes and title for existing saved pages.\n\n## Topic Manager can run in a tab\nAdded an option for the Topic Manager to run in a browser tab rather than the current side panel.\n\n## Performance Improvements\nBased on stressing BT with six thousand plus bookmarks a small tweak now avoids a low level recalculation of layout for every table row added resulting in a significant speed up for large topic trees. Search got similar performance attention and should now be snappier.\n\n## Search Improvements\nImprovements include better key handling on Linux, being able to 'escape' key out of search, restoring previous selection on failed search and a few other bug fixes.\n\n## Space key\nThe space key will now open a tab for the selected item if its not already open, and highlight it if it is open.\n\n# Earlier releases\n\n## Support for Edge and Brave browsers\nEdge users can get BrainTool at the Edge store. Brave users can install from the Chrome store.\n## File Import/Export\nIn addition to Chrome Bookmarks, 0.9 adds the ability to import from a TabsOutliner export and also to import a text file with org-mode markup.\n## org-mode Support\nBrainTool should now retain any org markup in the BrainTool.org file (or an imported file).\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n## Ability to tag all a windows tabs at once\n## Statistics Bar"

Whether you are logging into Facebook, Gmail, PayPal or Twitter, all secure websites offer an option to save passwords in the browser but none would reveal the passwords in plain text.\n\nMicrosoft Edge browser adds an eye icon to the password field to let you quickly mask and unmask the characters. This Google Chrome extension uses a similar approach. It shows the passwords when you focus the password field and replaces the characters with dots as soon as you move the cursor out of the password field.\n\nSome websites, for example PayPal, do not offer the option to save your password in the browser. \n\nThis Google Chrome extension overrides the default behaviour and lets you save the password so you can quickly login to your favourite websites without having to enter the password each time.

Customers also testify to a 20% reduction in waste as documents are only printed when the user releases them at the device they choose.\n\nPriApps tracks all print usage, as well as copy, scan & fax usage on copiers and MFPs for reporting, charge-back, cost recovery or analysis.\n\nPriApps also helps organizations reduce the cost of printing & copying by providing a powerful range of features that help manage or enforce print policies.  \n\nThese include:\n- Rules-based printing\n- Copy Control\n- Quota Management\n- Least-cost routing\n- Cost Recovery\n\nIn addition to print management, PriApps provides intuitive document capture through Personalized Scan Workflows.

      "full_description": "Unified WebSocket Edition - Real-time classroom monitoring and device management for AuthGuard\n\nIMPORTANT: This extension requires an active AuthGuard institutional account. It is designed exclusively for K-12 educational institutions and cannot be used without proper authorization from your school\u2019s IT administrator.\n\nOVERVIEW\nAuthGuard Classroom Monitor is a Chrome extension built for K-12 schools to ensure student safety and productive device usage in one-to-one Chromebook programs. It works only with the AuthGuard device management platform, providing real-time monitoring, safety alerts, and usage analytics.\n\nKEY REQUIREMENTS\nThe extension is for institutional use only. A school or district must have an active AuthGuard account. Setup and configuration must be done by an IT administrator. User credentials must be provided by the school. The extension requires a connection to the school\u2019s AuthGuard server. Individual users cannot sign up directly and schools must contact AuthGuard for licensing.\n\nCORE FEATURES\nTeachers can view student screens in real time during class to help keep students on task and to provide remote assistance when needed. Multi-monitor setups in labs are supported. The system provides student safety protection through AI-powered content categorization, inappropriate content detection, and keyword-based safety alerts. Critical issues immediately notify administrators. Screen time analytics provide detailed usage reports by category such as educational, entertainment, and social. Daily and weekly summaries help educators understand student behavior and distinguish productive from non-productive browsing. Device assignment management allows schools to track which student has which device, manage check-in and check-out for shared carts, monitor device status and location, and track repairs and the full device lifecycle. Classroom management tools allow teachers to see all student screens in a grid view, activate focus mode during tests, quickly view device information, and integrate with Google Workspace for Education.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nInstallation is handled by IT administrators through the Google Admin Console. Users authenticate by signing in with school-provided credentials. The extension automatically receives configuration from the AuthGuard server. Monitoring runs continuously in the background to ensure safety, and data is synced in real time to the AuthGuard dashboard.\n\nPRIVACY AND SECURITY\nAll data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Information is stored only on school-controlled AuthGuard servers and never sold or shared with third parties. The system complies with FERPA, COPPA, and GDPR. Access is limited to authorized school staff only. Role-based permissions allow for administrators, teachers, and IT staff. Students cannot disable the extension. Audit logs record all access and actions. Students are notified that school devices are monitored. Monitoring applies only to school-owned devices and never to personal devices. Schools are expected to communicate policies clearly.\n\nUSE CASES\nFor teachers, the extension provides live monitoring of screens, helps ensure focus on assignments, identifies students needing help, and prevents cheating during online assessments. For IT administrators, it allows centralized management of thousands of devices, tracking of device assignments and repairs, compliance reporting, and district-wide safety enforcement. For school safety teams, it provides immediate alerts of concerning behavior, documentation of incidents, coordination with counselors and administrators, and detailed audit trails for investigations.\n\nTECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\nThe extension requires ChromeOS version 100 or higher. Devices must be managed Chromebooks enrolled in Google Admin. An active internet connection is needed. The AuthGuard server must be version 3.0 or higher.\n\nGETTING STARTED\nSchools must contact AuthGuard for institutional licensing. Deployment documentation and training are provided. Setup is configured through the Google Admin Console and then deployed to managed devices. For testing and review, demo access is available including test credentials, a sample school environment, documentation, and technical support.\n\nSUPPORT\nSchools should contact their AuthGuard administrator or IT department. Administrators can visit support.authguard.com. Reviewers can email review@authguard.com\n for test credentials.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES\nThe extension will not work without valid AuthGuard credentials. It is not intended for personal use. Schools must establish proper consent and policies. Monitoring is intended to promote student safety and not surveillance.\n\nCOMPLIANCE\nAuthGuard Classroom Monitor helps schools meet duty of care obligations by preventing access to harmful content, detecting cyberbullying and self-harm indicators, maintaining CIPA compliance for E-Rate funding, supporting digital citizenship education, and providing evidence for disciplinary actions when required.\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nWebsite: www.userauthguard.com"

However, there are some super and sub Latin letters that have not yet been encoded by the Consortium, particularly for subscripts. In those cases a message will be displayed on the screen and the original typed character will appear instead. \n\nOnce installed, click on the SuperSub Extension Icon (top right corner of Chrome) to see the list of characters that have already been encoded and the required key to type.  I will of course update this list as soon as we get more super and sub glyphs encoded by the Consortium. \n\nFor the science and math symbols, I chose those that are, from my experience, the most commonly used in high school science and math and I tried to match the Greek letters to the closest corresponding Latin equivalents whenever I could. \n\nFor the overhead vector symbol, the vector symbol needs to be typed first and then the letter for the base. Placing a space before the overhead vector symbol may be necessary in some cases. \n\nFor accents above the letter: \n1. the letter needs to typed first,\n2. then press the ` key (usually found at the top left corner of  QWERTY keyboards),\n3. and then press the key corresponding to the accent that you want. \n\nHere are the keys for some of the most common accents:\n`1 for acute\n`2 for grave\n`3 for circumflex\n`4 for macron\n`5 for tilde\n`6 for breve\n`7 for hacek\n`8 for diaeresis or umlaut\n`9 for dot above\n`0 for ring above\n\nThere are other keys that will also trigger these accents. Click on the SuperSub Extension Icon for the full list of accents and some other international symbols.\n\nIn situations where you want ^ or _ or \\ or ` to appear in the text just press the key twice.\n\nShort Bio:\n\nHi, my name is Hyoun Park and I'm a high school teacher and developer living just north of Toronto in Canada.  I built this extension primarily for teachers and students. These days the need for simpler, more effective time-saving tools is an even greater imperative. I am also an associate member of the teachassist foundation."

Our software helps to stretch the video to be more horizontal and it allows you to use up the entire screen. The downside to this is the resolution would be a bit off, but its a tradeoff most users who have ultrawide monitors are willing to accept.\n\nThere is also another setting where the video can be cropped to fit your ultrawide monitor\n\nTry this software which is designed specifically for ultrawide monitors.\n\nUse the entire screen when you watch Youtube videos."

      "full_description": "Trying to make YouTube slightly safer for kids.\n\n----------------------\n   DESCRIPTION\n----------------------\n\nYouTube's parental controls are pretty much non-existent. Restrictive mode hides some things yes but not nearly enough. Plus there are no tracking/monitoring or filtering methods parents can use. On top of that the \"suggested\" and \"trending\" videos very often have content I personally wouldn't want my kids watching. \n\nThis extension is a very simple hack to hide most elements on the YouTube site and only show the basics. These lists may change over time but for now here's what is shown/hidden:\n\n----------------------\n  ITEMS SHOWN\n----------------------\n* Search Bar\n* Playlist menu/list\n* Subscriptions \n\n----------------------\n   ITEMS HIDDEN \n----------------------\n* Suggested / Next Up videos\n* Number of items in the left/side-menu on YouTube site\n* The GOD AWFUL \"Trending\" link\n* History link (harder for kids to clear history)\n* Video description\n* Video comments\n* Misc YouTube Header/Footer stuff\t\n\n----------------------\n   HOW TO USE \n----------------------\n\n1.) Install this extension. Enable it for \"Private/Incognito\" mode if necessary. \n2.) Go to YouTube\n3.) Enjoy a VERY minimal/bare-bones YouTube user interface \n    with 85% of the crap hidden.\n\n----------------------\n   DISCLAIMERS/NOTES\n----------------------\n\nA) Yes this is not super secure and anyone (incl kids) \n   of a certain age/technical skill will find ways around this \n   but it's better than nothing for people in my situation with \n   no other options.\n\nB) Please note that this extension may stop working to varying\n   degrees in the future if/when YouTube changes their site. I'll \n   update/fix if possible when time permits and/or I (or others)\n   are still using this.\n\nC) This extension is not meant to eliminate the need for parental\n   attention of what their kids are watching on YouTube - it's\n   just to help make parents' job a little bit easier and less stressful.\n\nD) This extension's toolbar icon is *intentionally* invisible so it's not\n   immediately obvious where/how to remove it. However it can be removed\n   in the usual extension/setting location.\n\nE) This extension is similar to the similarly-named extension \n   \"Safer YouTube\" by another person but that one didn't go far enough \n   (for me) in what it hides/shows so that's why I made my own. \n   Reference: https://goo.gl/TKqRtW.\n\nF) Finally, this is a test/work in progress. Please leave any \n   ideas/feedback anyone has here: \n  https://emersondesignlog.blogspot.com/2019/03/safer-youtube-ui-for-kids.html\n\n\n----------------------\n    CHANGE LOG\n----------------------\n1.0.017: YT Channel/YT Studio links removed from dropdown menu\n\n1.0.016: Adjustment requests from an end-user\n\n1.0.015: Resolving a chrome manifest V3/permission issue.\n\n1.0.014: The channel and subscribe buttons are now visible. The show-as-you-type search results is now hidden.\n\n1.0.0.13: Updated extension to V3 of Chrome manifest format. Also added few new YT items to hide on request from an end-user. \n\n20210627211035: Hiding couple additional items on YT home page (some, not all recommended \"channels/topics\").\n\n20210510075148: Google still rejecting app for configuration reasons (?) - still trying to resolve.\n\n2021042x: Google requested some configuration changes - attempting to resolve.\n\n\n20210407: Addressing some Chrome technical issue that came up and slight tweak to the extension to hide a couple more things on YT.\n\n20190319: Trying out hiding SUBSCRIBE button and AUTHOR/CHANNEL links.\nBy the way I *may* eventually make these toggles not global/hard-coded hide/show decision."

I have developed it for myself because I often lack the motivation to keep repeating for more than 10 minutes. \n\nHere is how it works:\n1) you enter a list of questions and answers in the following format:\n[question1]:[ansqer1]\n[question2]:[answer2]\nExample (learning german vocabulary):\nInventor:der erfinder\t\nArtist:der Kunstler\nPainter:der Maler\t\nHistory:die Geschichte\t\nGerman culture:die deutsche kultur\t\nand so on.\n\n2) Set the interval between asking each question.\n\n3) Click start. Questions are shuffled. When you answer correctly on the first or second try, the question will be removed from the list of asked questions. Questions will be asked until you are able to answer every single of them correctly, or until you click stop.\n\nGood luck memorizing!"

      "full_description": "Travel to the past of the web by right-clicking pages and links.\n\nMemento for Chrome allows you to seamlessly navigate between the present web and the web of the past. It turns your browser into a web time travel machine that is activated by means of a Memento sub-menu that is available on right-click.\n\nFirst, select a date for time travel by clicking the black Memento extension icon. Now right-click on a web page, and click the \"Get near \u2026\" option from the Memento sub-menu to see what the page looked like around the selected date. Do the same for any link in a page to see what the linked page looked like. If you hit one of those nasty \"Page not Found\" errors, right-click and select the \"Get near current time\" option to see what the page looked like before it vanished from the web. When on a past version of a page - the Memento extension icon is now red - right-click the page and select the \"Get current time\" option to see what it looks like now.\n\nMemento for Chrome obtains prior versions of pages from web archives around the world, including the massive web-wide Internet Archive, national archives such as the British Library and UK National Archives web archives, and on-demand web archives such as archive.is. It also allows time travel in all language versions of Wikipedia. There's two things Memento for Chrome can not do for you: obtain a prior version of a page when none have been archived and time travel into the future. Our sincere apologies for that.\n\nTechnically, the Memento for Chrome extension is a client-side implementation of the Memento protocol that extends HTTP with content negotiation in the date time dimension. Many web archives have implemented server-side support for the Memento protocol, and, in essence, every content management system that supports time-based versioning can implement it. Technical details are in the Memento Internet Draft at http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/ID/. General information about the protocol, including a quick introduction, is available at http://mementoweb.org.\n\nFor queries about the Memento for Chrome extension and the Memento protocol, get in touch at memento-dev@googlegroups.com."

      "full_description": "Optimise TradingView Strategies An assistant for optimising (Optimize) & backtesting trading strategies in Tradingview\n\nOptimise TradingView Strategies An assistant for optimising & backtesting trading strategies in Tradingview.\nAn optimizing assistant for backtesting trading strategies and showing external signals in Tradingview\nAn assistant for backtesting trading strategies and checking (showing) external signals in Tradingview.\n\nFunctionality\n1. Backtesting trading strategies, optimisation of the strategy's parameters:\n* automatic getting a list of parameters and their types (numeric, lists and checkboxes are supported)\n* generation of the testing range according to the rule: the beginning value is 2 times less than the current one, the end is 2 times more than the current one.\n* saving the generated parameters of testing a trading strategy for their correction as a template in a file in CSV format\n* Loading adjusted parameter ranges from a CSV file\n* Configuring the optimisation model:\n    * Choosing the type of optimisation: searching for the maximum or minimum values\n    * Selecting an optimised value from the entire list of strategy results in Tradingview (Net Profit, Ratio Avg Win / Avg Loss, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, etc.)\n    * Choosing a search strategy in the parameter space(random, sequential, annealing method)\n* Filtering of unsuitable results. For example, the number of tradings is less than necessary\n* Setting the number of cycles to search for parameters.\n* Performing automatic selection of parameters with storing all the results in the browser storage and the ability to save them as CSV files after testing, including in case of an error or page reloading\n* Showing backtesting results on 3d chartto analyze the effect of various parameters on the result.\n\n2. Upload external signals to Tradingview chart\n\nLoading external buy or sell signals by timestamps from a CSV file\n\nOptimization Methods\n\nThe sequential improvements optimization method is implement adjusting the best value already found. It does not perform a complete search of the entire parameter space.\nThe logic of it work is as follows. The current best state (parameters for max results) is taken. The first parameter is taken and all its values in the range are checked sequentially. If the best result is found, then further verification is carried out from this state. Then the next parameter is taken and all its values in the range are checked and etc.\n\nThe brute force optimization method implement backtesting all values in strategy space of parameters.\n\nThe annealing method is an optimization method in which the search for the maximum possible result is carried out in fewer steps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing\nThe method works this way: first, the best state and its parameters are determined. One parameter is randomly determined, then its value from range of possible values is randomly selected. The status in this value is checked. If it is better, then it is remembered and further parameter changes are made from it.\nAs the number of tests increases, the spread of parameter values decreases around those already found. That is, if at the beginning of testing the values are randomly selected from the entire range of possible parameter values, then as optimization is carried out, this spread decreases (\"cools down\") near current values. So in first phase of test - this method is search the most possible state around all space on the finish stage this method trying to improve found best state.\nSo that the system does not get stuck in one parameter area, as it happens with the sequential method, not one random parameter changes periodically, but all at once.\n\nThe random improvements method is the simplest. One parameter is randomly determined and then a value is randomly selected for it from the entire range of possible values. If the condition is better, then it is remembered. And then the parameters from this state are randomly changed.\n\nThe random method - always selects random values for all parameters at once (default)\n\n\nDeclaimer.\n\nThis extension is open source and aims to reduce the manual operations of users when working with the Tradingview by implementing the technology of emulation of user actions.

Ensure website updates meet performance standards.  \n\n\ud83d\udccf Which Core Web Vitals metrics are calculated?\n\n\u2705 LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) is a Core Web Vitals metric that measures the time it takes for the largest visible content element on a webpage to fully load and become visible to the user. This content is typically the largest image, video, or block of text in the viewport. LCP is an important indicator of page performance and user experience, as it reflects how quickly users can see and interact with the main content of the page. Google recommends an LCP time of 2.5 seconds or less for a good user experience.\n\n\u2705 CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) is a Core Web Vitals metric that measures the visual stability of a webpage by tracking unexpected layout shifts during the page's lifecycle. These shifts occur when visible elements, such as images, buttons, or text, move unexpectedly while the page is loading or in response to dynamic content.  \nCLS is calculated based on the size of the unstable elements and the distance they move in relation to the viewport. A low CLS score (ideally 0.1 or less) indicates a stable and user-friendly experience, while a high score suggests disruptive layout shifts that can frustrate users.\n\n\u2705 INP (Interaction to Next Paint) is a Core Web Vitals metric that measures the responsiveness of a webpage by evaluating how quickly it reacts to user interactions, such as clicks, taps, or keyboard inputs. INP focuses on the time between the user's interaction and the next visual update (paint) that reflects the response.  \nThis metric helps identify delays in interactivity and measures the page's ability to respond promptly to user actions. A good INP value is 200 milliseconds or less, indicating a responsive and seamless user experience. High INP values suggest sluggish interactivity, which can frustrate users.\n\n\u2705 FCP (First Contentful Paint) is a web performance metric that measures the time it takes for a browser to render the first piece of content from the DOM after a user navigates to a page. This content could be text, an image, or a non-white background, and it signals to the user that the page is starting to load.  \nFCP is a key indicator of perceived loading speed, as it provides the first visual feedback to users. Google recommends an FCP time of 1.8 seconds or less for a good user experience.\n\n\u2705 TTFB (Time to First Byte) is a web performance metric that measures the time it takes for a user's browser to receive the first byte of data from the server after making an HTTP request.  \nTTFB is an important metric for evaluating server responsiveness and overall website performance. Lower TTFB values (ideally less than 200 milliseconds) indicate faster server responses and a better user experience.\n\n\ud83d\ude80 This extension makes the process of analyzing Core Web Vitals accessible, convenient, and efficient, enabling you to better meet the requirements of search engines and users. It is an excellent tool for improving performance, enhancing user experience, and achieving SEO goals."

You can see progress of conversation sync in the sidebar.\n\nhttps://myextension.store/searchable-chatgpt/\n\nHow does it work\n\nIt creates a local index of all the chats and messages you have. It also adds a button in the sidebar and a hotkey to open the search (\u2328\ufe0f Ctrl-Shift-P). When you type in the search box, it uses the local index to find the messages that match your query.\n\nWhy do I need it\n\nCurrently ChatGPT does not offer any way to find old chats other than just scrolling and looking through all of them. If you have numerous chats in ChatGPT web UI and regularly need to find something you've already discussed, this is just for you.\n\nDoes it search contents of the chats?\n\nYes, it creates an index of both chat names and chat messages. You can search for any word or phrase that was ever mentioned in any of your chats. After you first install the extension, please give it some time to fetch the index. Chat names are retrieved immediately, but messages may take a few minutes to fetch.\n\nWhat are limitations of \ud83c\udd93 free version?\n\n\ud83c\udd93 Free version searches through all your chats and messages. Only limitation of free version is 3 search results per search."

Paste in the program of your choice. It will preserve new lines.\n\nDoes it work with PDFs in the browser?\nYes! It works with PDF files in the browser if you are using Google Chrome's default PDF Viewer. However, it will not preserve line feeds and the user has to use the right-click context menu > Copy as Plain Text... > Copy as Plain Text... It will not work with a keyboard shortcut or the button in the popup with PDFs.  In other cases, the PDF viewer used or the PDF file may have a security policy that doesn't even allow the right-click context menu to read any data. If that is the case, and the PDF allows copying of rich text, then an option is the in-app purchase for the button in the pop-up called \"Convert Clipboard to Plain Text\".\n\nWhere is the extension icon on the Chrome toolbar?\nIf you can't find the extension icon  on the Chrome toolbar then following these instructions:\n1. Click on the \"Extensions\" icon \ud83e\udde9 that looks like a jigsaw puzzle piece in the top right corner of the browser toolbar.\n2.

Page title and description (including the current and maximum recommended character count)\n2. Page URL\n3. Canonical tag (lets search engines know which URL is the main one)\n4. Robots.txt (file that helps search engines understand which pages to crawl)\n5. Sitemap (list of all the essential pages of your website)\n6.

Core web vitals (Google\u2019s user experience metrics)\n8. List of heading levels and their count\n9. Link, image, word, and paragraph count on the page\n\n\u270d\ufe0f Heading Tags List\n\nTinyIMG gives you a full list of all-level headings found on the page to help visualize the structural content organization better.\n\nYou can also automatically highlight heading levels in the text to see where they\u2019re placed within the content.\n\nPlus, TinyIMG allows you to export the whole heading list into a CSV format for further analysis.\nSince search engines use heading tags to comprehend the hierarchy of page content, the extension can help users optimize their content structure to achieve higher rankings or analyze competitor pages.\n\n\ud83d\udcc4 Page Status\n\nTinyIMG shows you current page status insights, which allows you to see the full redirect path. You may encounter such status codes as 200 (loaded), 404 (not found), 301 (permanently redirected), 302 (temporarily redirected), 500 (server error), and so on.\n\nThis feature is useful for identifying any redirect chains that can tamper with page loading time, SEO efforts, or user experience.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Link Insights\n\nThis TinyIMG feature crawls the full list of links that are present within the page and checks their status codes. This is useful for quickly identifying which pages are loading and which return error codes.\n\nThe feature allows you to filter the results by link type (external or internal), meta robot directives (dofollow, nofollow, Sponsored, or UGC links), or placement (text or image).\n\nFor extra convenience, you can highlight all links within the page or use the search functionality to find specific ones. Plus, you can export the data into a CSV format.\n\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Image Details\n\nTinyIMG presents you with a list of images within a page and information about them. You can view the image URL and alt text, including the current and maximum recommended character count. There\u2019s also an option to filter images and quickly find which ones are missing the alt text.\n\nThe highlight functionality lets you easily see where the images are placed in the content. You can also download the data in CSV format with a single click.\n\nOptimizing your images helps search engines navigate your content and increases chances to rank in regular organic and image search results.\n\n\ud83d\udcd3 Schema Overview\n\nTinyIMG quickly shows you the Microdata and JSON-LD structured data that the page contains in a simplified manner.\n\nIt organizes the schema types in a hierarchical order by numbering them and demonstrating their structure within the code. You can also conveniently expand them and view the nested schema parameters.\n\n\ud83c\udf10 Social Media Content Metadata\n\nThe Social feature in the TinyIMG extension shows whether the page is using the Open Graph (og:) protocol. You can view its different properties, including title, type, image, URL, site name, and description, and find what\u2019s missing.\n\nYou can also use the Preview functionality which redirects you to an external site. It gives you a visual demonstration of how the URL will look like on different social media channels, including Facebook, X, Discord, and LinkedIn.\n\nIn case you have any questions, you can contact our support team on our official website: https://tiny-img.com/?open-support=true"
